	 * 
	 * Discussion on HystrixProperty
	 * <ol>
	 * <li><b>execution.isolation.strategy:</b> The value of "SEMAPHORE" enables
	 * Hystrix to use the current thread for executing this command. Since we
	 * need to use the parent HttpRequest to pass the OAuth2 access token, we
	 * are constrained in using the calling thread. The number of concurrent
	 * requests that can be made to the command is limited by the semaphore(or
	 * counter) value; default is 10.In a normal scenario, you would use
	 * isolation strategy of "THREAD" that executes the Hystrix command in a
	 * separate thread pool. This is desirable because it doesn't block the
	 * calling thread and lets us handle faulty client libraries, client
	 * performance considerations etc.</li>
	 * <li><b>circuitBreaker.requestVolumeThreshold:</b>This property sets the
	 * minimum number of requests in a rolling window that will trip the
	 * circuit. For example, if the value is 20, then if only 19 requests are
	 * received in the rolling window (say a window of 10 seconds) the circuit
	 * will not trip open even if all 19 failed. We have a lower value in this
	 * sample application so as to trip early.</li>
	 * <li><b>circuitBreaker.sleepWindowInMilliseconds:</b>This property sets
	 * the amount of time, after tripping the circuit, to reject requests before
	 * allowing attempts again to determine if the circuit should again be
	 * closed. We again have a lower value so that Hystrix tries to pass single
	 * request to the called service quickly.</li>
	 * </ol>
